Project Goals

A complete automated test tool. I don't want to have to fallback to Ruby libraries to do automated test runs.

Selenium Java wrapper (might push into a separate library with a nice DSL?)

Basic functionality ideas

1. Testing URLS

- Check status codes
- Parse a text file containing a list of URLs and check each one is returning the correct status

(testcase [])
